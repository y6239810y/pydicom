Test of pydicom clone for slicer. http://code.google.com/p/pydicom/  

Since pydicom itself is hosted in hg, it is
not possible to fork it directly.

Instead, this git repository includes a read-only hg checkout
(in the .hg directory).  This means that anyone who checks out 
this clone can updated it using hg commands and then (in needed) 
push the new code back into the git repository.

Created with:

 hg clone https://code.google.com/p/pydicom/
 cd pydicom/
 git init
 git commit -m "Initial commit, including hg checkout"
 git remote add origin git@github.com:pieper/pydicom.git
 git push -u origin master
